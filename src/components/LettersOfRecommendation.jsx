Dear Sir/Madame:
This is a letter of recommendation for Miss Fnu Pratichi. I have known Miss Fnu for about one year. She took my Data Mining course in the fall of 2024. She was one of the best students in my class. She has demonstrated the capacity to carry out independent projects and worked very hard to finish extra assignments for the course.
In this course, Miss Fnu had to write a research term paper and develop and present a data science project. I sensed clarity of thought and an ease of communication necessary for successful software engineer.
I am impressed with Miss Fnu’s intelligence, scientific abilities, and hard work.
She is very apt and highly prepared for a software internship position. She also has the seriousness and diligence necessary for completing assigned tasks.
In all, I believe that Miss Fnu will be a highly qualified software engineer at your organization. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at Tel: (703) 507-1736.
Sincerely,
Abdelghani Bellaachia, Ph.D.
